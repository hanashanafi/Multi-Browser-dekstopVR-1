This version is the first version.
In this Multi-Browser Desktop VR, navigation uses standard computer peripherals (computer mouse, keyboard, and monitor).
The player mode is 3D mode and 2D mode.
In the 3D mode, the player can explore the entire virtual environment.
In the 2D mode, the player can focus on one web browser.
In this first version, the navigation focused on using a computer mouse. Holding the middle click (mouse roller) rotates the player, and holding the right click moves the player inside the virtual environment.
