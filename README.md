# Multi-Browser-dekstopVR-1
This game is a Multi-Browser Desktop VR that can be run with Windows (.exe) using standard computer peripherals (mouse, keyboard, and monitor) without a Head Mounted Display. This system developed using Unity 2022.3.10f1 <br><br>
The Multi-Browser Desktop VR is designed by utilizing nine browsers arranged in a semi-circular manner. Navigation in this system uses a standard computer mouse. In this version, hold the right click and move the mouse according to the x and y axes for the user's position movement. As for rotation, hold the middle, click on the roller and utilize the mouse x-axis (Twist-Nav).<br><br>
User modes in the virtual environment consist of full 3D mode (i.e., users can explore their entire environment and see more than one browser at a time) and 2D mode (i.e., users can focus on interacting with only one browser).<br><br>
