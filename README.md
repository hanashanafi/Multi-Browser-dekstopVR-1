This game is a Multi-Browser Desktop VR that can be run with Windows (.exe) using standard computer peripherals (mouse, keyboard, and monitor) without a Head Mounted Display.<br><br>
This game is designed by utilizing nine browsers arranged in a semi-circular manner.<br><br>
Navigation in Desktop VR uses a standard computer mouse. In this version, hold the right click and move the mouse according to the x and y axes for the user's position movement. As for rotation, hold the middle, click on the roller and utilize the mouse x-axis (Twist-Nav).<br><br>
